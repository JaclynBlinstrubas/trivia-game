## Unsolved Problems and Major Hurdles
- I had trouble figuring out how I was going to code my question and answer sequence event listener. I started with button1 connecting to all the button1's of each question. And same for button2, button3, and button4. There would have been 10 if-statements for each button and it was very confusing. I was able to work to cut it down to just one event listener for my answer buttons and have all my logic within that code. I was able to add my fuctions to renew the questions and answers each time the play chooses the correct answer. 
- I would have liked to add a condition where if the player chooses the wrong asnwer, the game just moves along to the next question and does not log any points. However, this works to meet a players basic needs. I will work to update this unsolved problem.
- As this is my first coding project, I feel the whole process was difficult. I can see how everything I have learned to this point was used in this game, such as if-statements, event listeners, and functions, etc. I am looking forward to getting more practice so it becomes more natural and understandable.
